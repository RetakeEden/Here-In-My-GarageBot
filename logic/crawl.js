A long time ago in a galaxy far far away…

DRONEDEPLOY, a brilliant company using aerial drones to bring easily readable and actionable data to agriculture, construction, and cartography, is searching avidly for an intelligent JAVASCRIPT ENGINEER. They have scoured the market and posted jobs in a hope of coming across a talented developer.

Coming into contact with one of the job postings, ADAM YOUNGBLOOD sends an application in, certain he is a perfect fit for the team. His experience with jQuery, AngularJS, Node.js and Express make him a valuable front- and back-end asset. His sense of humor, and friendly demeanor accentuate the fit.

Will DRONEDEPLOY have found their perfect match? With the contract looming, the choice is as important as ever…..

I love the idea of asking a couple in-depth questions as part of the application process.

In terms of answers, I’d have to say my absolute favorite project was the chatbot that I put together for personal use among my voice channels. It was exceptionally JavaScript heavy, and problem-solving was a big component. It’s also the project I’ve spent the most time on. Funny enough, it was initially just a joke bot that a buddy of mine had come up with. As I thought more about it, I decided to do some research and see if what he dreamt up was possible. After finding the Discord.js API library, I knew it could be done. I spent about six hours that night putting together a prototype, and have spent many a night since then tooling with it to improve, and add on. Just recently I implemented the Giphy API. While in school at General Assembly, we used Slack for communication and their implementation of the Giphy API fascinated me. It took me roughly a day to get working without bugs, but it’s fully functional and frankly pretty fun. There’s a link to the project on my portfolio site at www.adamyoungblood.net. Check it out! It’s pretty awesome!

Towards adding a new feature to an upcoming JS spec, I wouldn’t say so much as adding a feature but more of a “Wow, this is really the way to go”. I read through JavaScript Weekly every time it pops up in my e-mail. Just recently there was talk of the framework Svelte. Svelte really drew my attention because of how incredibly lightweight of a framework it is. I think we’re all guilty of being on mobile and getting frustrated at a site’s loading time. Considering Svelte was a good 30-200kb lighter than all widely-used frameworks (and even this e-mail), it really is pushing the boundary of speed. I’d have to say if I really wanted to add a feature, I’d rather subtract a few that aren’t terribly useful, and create something a bit more modular. I typically use Angular, and compared to Backbone it is extremely rigid. I love Angular, it’s exceptionally useful and honestly does a lot of the work for me, but I have to say Backbone’s modular setup mean it’s considerably more lightweight and quick-loading, and I only have to load dependencies for things I actually need.


Mr. Mike Winn,

My name is Adam Youngblood. I’m a Web Developer with a passion for great ideas and fantastic approaches. DroneDeploy and their methodology definitely fits both of those. The vision your company exerts around the app is truly fantastic. You take a modern idea, and turn it on its head to provide an even more modern set of solutions. The doors and possibilities that are opened by this technology is endless, and by providing an easy to access platform for users, it’s truly a fascinating direction.

As someone with experience with JavaScript, Node, Ruby, Rails, Angular, Express, and a multitude of other frameworks and technologies, I believe I am a perfect fit for your team. My innovative solutions, quick learning, and ease of understanding allow me to fit quickly into any environment I’m placed, and excel just as fast. My penchant for problem-solving and creative thinking makes my solutions unique, efficient, and often quite elegant.

I believe the type of work your company does is very very forward-thinking, and I would love to become a part of it, even if only for the contract duration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Adam Youngblood
